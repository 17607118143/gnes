# Contributing to GNES

ðŸ™‡ Thanks for your interest in contributing! GNES always welcome the contribution from the open-source community, individual committers and other partners. Without you, GNES can't be successful.

Currently there are three major directions of contribution:
- **Porting state-of-the-art models to GNES**. This includes new preprocessing algorithms, new DNN networks for encoding, and new high-performance index. Believe me, it is super easy to wrap an algorithm and use it in GNES. Checkout this example.
- **Adding tutorial and learning experience**. What is good and what can be improved? If you apply GNES in your domain, whether it's about NLP or CV, whether it's a blog post or a Reddit/Twitter thread, we are always eager to hear your thoughts.
- **Completing the user experience of other programming languages**. GNES offers a generic interface with gRPC and protobuf, therefore it is easy to add an interface for other languages, e.g. Java, C, Go.

## Commit Message Naming

To help everyone with understanding the commit history of GNES, we employ [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) in the CI pipeline to enforce the commit styles. Specifically, our convention is:

```text
type(scope?): subject
```

where `type` is one of the following:

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

`scope` is optional, represents the module your commit working on.

`subject` explains the commit.

As an example, a commit that implements a new encoder should be phrased as:
```text
feat(encoder): add new inceptionV3 as image encoder
``` 

## Merging Process

A pull request has to meet the following conditions to be merged into master:

- Coding style check (PEP8, via Codacy)
- Commit style check (in CI pipeline via Drone.io)
- Unit tests (via Drone.io)
- Review and approval from a GNES team member.

After the merging is triggered, the build will be delivered to the followings:

- **Docker Hub**: `gnes:latest` will be updated.
- **Tencent Container Service**: `gnes:latest` will be updated.
- **ReadTheDoc**: `latest` will be updated.

Note that merging into master does not mean an official releasing. For the releasing process, please refer to the next section.

## Release Process

A new release is scheduled on every Friday (triggered and approved by Han Xiao) summarizing all new commits since the last release. The release will increment the third (revision) part of the version number, i.e. from `0.0.24` to `0.0.25`.

After a release is triggered, the build will be delivered to the followings:

- **Docker Hub**: a new image with the release version tag will be created, `gnes:latest` will be updated.
- **Tencent Container Service**: a new image with the release version tag will be created, `gnes:latest` will be updated.
- **PyPi Package**: a new version of Python package is uploaded to Pypi, allowing one to `pip install -U gnes` 
- **ReadTheDoc**: a new version of the document will be built, `latest` will be updated and the old version will be achieved.

Meanwhile, a new pull request containing the updated [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and the new version number will be made automatically, pending for review and merge.

#### Major and minor version increments

- MAJOR version when GNES make incompatible API changes;
- MINOR version when GNES add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.

The decision of incrementing major and minor version, i.e. from `0.0.0` to `0.1.0` or from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`, is made by the GNES team.

## Testing Locally

The best way to test GNES is using a Docker container, in which you don't have to worry about the dependencies.

We provide a public Docker image `gnes/ci-base`, which contains the required dependencies and some pretrained models used in our continuous integration pipeline.

You can [find the image at here](https://cloud.docker.com/u/gnes/repository/docker/gnes/ci-base) or pull the image via:
```bash
docker pull gnes/ci-base
```

To test GNES inside this image, you may run

```bash
docker run --network=host --rm --entrypoint "/bin/bash" -it gnes/ci-base

# now you are inside the 'gnes/ci-base' container
# first sync your local modification, then
pip install -e .[all]
python -m unittest tests/*.py
```
